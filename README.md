# Camera-Caliberaion
Caliberation.py does single camera caliberation.
StereoCaliberation.py does stereo caliberation, stereo rectify, remapping and disparity computation. The result of rectify is unsatisfactory.
The reason may be that the camera matrix estimated by my program is quite different by the ideal one: https://blog.csdn.net/zc850463390zc/article/details/48975263, and I cannot figure out the reason.
